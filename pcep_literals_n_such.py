print("2")  # string
print(2)  # integer

#  both are literals

#  always use underscores in numeric literals

# negative numbers can be represented with a negative signa nd positive a plus.


print(-149_863)
print(+69_420)  # plus sign is optional

#  getting weird with octal and hexadecimals

print(0o123)  # 0o makes this an octal value

print(0x123)  # 0x makes this a hex value
